Welcome to my personal webiste! I am a PhD candidate considering opportunities in both academia and industry after my thesis defence in 2022. This website serves as an online version of my CV to share information about my work, education, and experience. Please have a look around and feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaboration!

I am currently studying for a PhD in Behavioural Genetics and Bioinformatics at the University of Hong Kong under the guidance of [Pak C. Sham](https://shamlab.github.io/). Generally, I am interested in developing and applying statistical and machine learning methods to big data to gain insight into the influence of our genes and environment on complex diseases, especially mental health, but my projects span a range of traits and methodologies.

Befrore moving to Hong Kong, I worked as a Post-Baccalaureate Fellow at the National Institutes of Health where I gained experience in MRI, autonomic, and psyhcological data collection and analysis under [M. Catherine Bushnell](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/about/staff/m-catherine-bushnell) while conducting research on neurophysiological aspects of pain perception and their relation to mood and attention.

While studying my dual undergraduate degrees in Biology and Psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University, I had the opportunity to  work under [Danielle Dick](https://psychology.vcu.edu/people/faculty/dick.html) to complete an undergraduate research project to understand the relationship between mindfulness, genetic risk for anxiety, and mental health. I also had the chance to work in the Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab of [Kirk W. Brown](https://wellbeinglaboratory.org/), where I learned to collect and analyze EEG, behavioural, and self report data while studying the influence of mindfulness on empathy and pro-social behavior.
