My research career has spanned a veriety of focus areas and methodologies, which has given me a strong appreciation for collaboration and interdisciplinary research. Here are some of the projects I have been involved in:



### The University of Hong Kong

- **Optimal Smoothing of Time-to-Event Curves from Interval Censored Data**
  - _Developed a novel methodology for improving the estimation and prediction accuracy of onset curves from longitudinal data using an EM algorithm and penalty optimization._
- **Estimating Parental Genetic Effects from Incomplete Data**
  - _Introduced a method for recovering missing parental genotype data to allow unbiased estimation of their effects on offspring phenotypes, with derived formulae for power and bias characteristics. In collaboration with David Evans' team at the University of Queensland._
- **Genetic Nurture and Child BMI Trajectories**
  - _Used poygenic risk scores to estimate maternal genetic effects on offspring BMI across development._



### The National Institutes of Health

- **Sensory and Opioid Mechanisms of Affective Touch**
  - _fMRI brain study measuring responses to simulated affective touch and pain before and after endogenous opioid blockade in a controlled, double-blind crossover design._
- **Effects of External Ear Stimulation on Pain Perception and Mood**
  - _Examining the effects of transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation on pain perception, mood, and autonomic response to heat pain stimuli._



### Virginia Commonwealth University

- **Spit for Science: The VCU Student Survey**
  - _Used polygenic scores and survey data to examine the relationship between mindfulness, genetic risk for anxiety, and internalizing disorders within the longitudinal Spit for Science dataset._
- **Mindfulness Training and Prosocial Responsiveness in Interracial Interactions**
  - _A randomized controlled experiment to examine the effects of mindfulness training on helping behavior, changes in electroencephalography patterns, and components of empathy._
